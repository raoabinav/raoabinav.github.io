Hey, I'm a current undergrad at UC Berkeley, and work in LLM Research, trying to make efficient encoders on LLMs + applying agentic-workflows on more complex workflows than a to-do app.

I read tons of ML-adjacent research papers, but I know the pain of osentensible, verbose math - so decided to break down into intutive and insight-ordered pieces here :)

(Ordering is loosely based on what I read in my classes, work, research, or anything cool I read on twitter.) Feel free to reach out and enjoy!
